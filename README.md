## Web app to track and calculate how long to finish your videogame backlog on a tight schedule

The Busy Gamer Web App allows you to track videogames that you want to play, and makes an approximation of how long is going to take you to finish those games, based on your schedule. Powered by How Long To Beat API.

The reasoning behind this app is that not every gamer can afford to play more than 1 to 2 hours sometimes, you can either need to go to work, or lack a lot of free time. This app is meant for you, the gamers who want to check how long it would take to finish every single Persona Videogame lol.

## Features

* **Game Tracking:** Keep a list of video games you want to play.
* **Time Estimation:** Calculate how long it will take you to finish your games based on you gaming schedule, either by it being weekly or daily basis.
* [**How Long To Beat API Integration:**](https://github.com/ckatzorke/howlongtobeat) Accurate game completion time data gathered from How Long to Beat.

## Dependencies

The Busy Gamer Web App was made in conjunction with [TheBusyGamerAppAPI](https://github.com/EmilioBlacksmith/TheBusyGamerAppAPI), the backend NodeJS/Express App to handle the latest search queries, and the latest games being played currently.
